## Experience

### Senior Principal Applications Architect

#### Oracle2017 - Present

-   Turned an Innovation Day project that I created into a critical
    business tool that exposed a visual workflow to collect, compare,
    publish, and deploy application configurations from across multiple
    product lines in a central and consistent interface. This reduced
    implementation and setup costs by 50% (NodeJS, React, OpenAPI)
-   Developed the architecture to expose our 50+ customer energy insight
    widgets natively within our utility customer websites as custom
    elements instead of iframes. This drastically improved the load time
    and integration experience for our customers. (Webpack, NodeJS,
    SASS)
-   Successfully led the ingress routing datacenter migration into the
    Oracle Cloud using an F5 Load Balancer. I turned 20,000+ lines of
    nginx/HAProxy routing configuration, which was handcrafted over the
    previous 10 years, into tested and consistent configuration driven
    ingress rules. (F5 iRule, TCL, Chef)

### Software Architect

-   Responsible for hiring, mentoring, and leading backend and frontend
    web-focused platform engineers.
-   Developed a suite of test automation tooling to standardize our
    browser test ecosystem. (Selenium, NodeJS)
-   Leveraged our widget build platform to develop sales tools to
    configure client demos of our real products on demand and inject
    them directly into the customer site, fully configured to match
    their branding and user flows (React)
-   Led the automation of our Merger and Acquisition licensing
    compliance audit and remediation across a massive and diverse set of
    applications and repositories. (NodeJS)
-   Developed a Slack bot that became central to the workflows of our
    entire organization, injecting contextual information about JIRA,
    GitHub, Jenkins, Nomad, PagerDuty, etc. into conversations.

### Senior Software Developer

#### Opower (acquired by Oracle)October 2013 - 2015

-   Turned an Innovation Day project into the foundational SDK and
    production content server that still powers our internal widget
    development teams today. (NodeJS, Webpack)
-   Developed a tool to visualize our application relationship graph and
    associated metadata. This provided key discoverability and
    onboarding of new (and old) employees to the vast ecosystem of
    microservices and their roles and owners. (Cytoscape, NodeJS)
